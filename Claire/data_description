The dataset in this project is from the Kaggle open source, A Million News Headlines.

The dataset contains data of news headlines published over a period of nineteen years.

Sourced from the reputable Australian news source ABC (Australian Broadcasting Corporation)
Start Date: 2003-02-19 ; End Date: 2021-12-31

(The dataset is too large to train the model,1213004 news headlines, which need more than 10h; so I take 5% data of the while dataset for training in this project)
