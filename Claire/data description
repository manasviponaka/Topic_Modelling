dataset
A Million News Headlines is the dataset that contains data of news headlines published over a period of nineteen years from early-2003 to end-2021 with a more granular focus on Australia. This dataset includes the entire corpus of articles published by the abcnews website (1213004 news headlines) and a good focus on international news, which is a summarised historical record of noteworthy events in the globe.

Digging into the news headlines, we can get all the important episodes shaping the last decade and how they evolved over time. Such as: covid epidemic, Afghanistan war, financial crisis, multiple elections, ecological disasters, terrorism, famous people, criminal activity etc. 

The dataset is too large to process at once, so we analyze the news from 2017 to 2022.
